The next year brought \"replacement notes\" of the 1, 5 and 10 Pesos while 1944 ushered in a 100 Peso note and soon after an inflationary 500 Pesos note. In 1945, the Japanese issued a 1,000 Pesos note. This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation. Anti-Japanese newspapers portrayed stories of going to the market laden with suitcases or \"bayong\" (native bags made of woven coconut or Corypha leaf strips) overflowing with the Japanese-issued bills. In 1944, a box of matches cost more than 100 Mickey Mouse pesos. In 1945, a kilogram of camote cost around 1000 Mickey Mouse pesos.

They had left the town of Verín, 12 kilometers from the northern border with Spain, and had marched towards the border. Most of the men were from the region of Trás-os-Montes and were from a diverse array of social classes and skills. There were more than 100 priests in the group. In terms of military equipment, there were only 400 ancient rifles, a few Winchester rifles, and Mauser Pocket Pistols adapted to rifles, to which were added a score of semi-automatic pistols, daggers, and swords. The 1,000 men had crossed the border after a long march in the mountainous region between Bragança and Vinhais, near the present-day Montesinhos National Park. The republican garrison in Bragança had waited for an attack that never came. This is because the royalists had changed their plans and now marched on Vinhais, which had a smaller garrison of men—only eighty infantry, cavalry and border guards. These forces from Vinhais had left the small town and had concentrated on a hill nearby. Negotiations were begun but the military commander of Vinhais refused to join or to surrender.

In September 1974, Emperor Haile Selassie had been overthrown by the Derg , marking a period of turmoil. The Derg quickly fell into internal conflict to determine who would have primacy. Meanwhile, various anti-Derg as well as separatist movements began throughout the country. The regional balance of power now favoured Somalia. One of the separatist groups seeking to take advantage of the chaos was the pro-Somalia Western Somali Liberation Front  operating in the Somali-inhabited Ogaden area, which by late 1975 had struck numerous government outposts. From 1976 to 1977, Somalia supplied arms and other aid to the WSLF. A sign that order had been restored among the Derg was the announcement of Mengistu Haile Mariam as head of state on February 11, 1977. However, the country remained in chaos as the military attempted to suppress its civilian opponents in a period known as the Red Terror . Despite the violence, the Soviet Union, which had been closely observing developments, came to believe that Ethiopia was developing into a genuine Marxist-Leninist state and that it was in Soviet interests to aid the new regime. They thus secretly approached Mengistu with offers of aid that he accepted. Ethiopia closed the U.S. military mission and the communications centre in April 1977. In June 1977, Mengistu accused Somalia of infiltrating SNA soldiers into the Somali area to fight alongside the WSLF.

The siege signalled the pinnacle of the Ottoman Empire\\'s power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe. Thereafter, 150 years of bitter military tension and reciprocal attacks ensued, culminating in the Battle of Vienna of 1683, which marked the start of the 15-year-long Great Turkish War. The inability of the Ottomans to capture Vienna in 1529 turned the tide against almost a century of conquest throughout eastern and central Europe. The Ottoman Empire had previously annexed Central Hungary and established a vassal state in Transylvania in the wake of the Battle of Mohács. According to Arnold J. Toynbee, \"The failure of the first  brought to a standstill the tide of Ottoman conquest which had been flooding up the Danube Valley for a century past.\" There is speculation by some historians that Suleiman\\'s main objective in 1529 was actually to assert Ottoman control over the whole of Hungary, the western part of which  was under Habsburg control. The decision to attack Vienna after such a long interval in Suleiman\\'s European campaign is viewed as an opportunistic manoeuvre after his decisive victory in Hungary.

In 1328, Öz Beg granted Ivan Kalita the duchies of Novgorod and Kostroma. Alexander Vasilyevich, the prince of Suzdal, received Vladimir and a region encompassing present day Nizhny Novgorod and Gorodets. By granting the more prestigious Vladimir to the weaker of the two princes, Öz Beg maintained adherence to the principle of \"divide and rule,\" reasoning that Moscow\\'s jealousy of Suzdal\\'s lands would prevent them from allying to fight against the Golden Horde. Alexander moved to Sweden after his time in Lithuania, and then back to Pskov after the city\\'s excommunication was lifted, under the patronage of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1335, he gained forgiveness from Öz Beg and was allowed to return to his former position in Tver, however by then, the state had lost most of its influence, being replaced by the Grand Duchy of Muscovy. This return did not last long, as both Alexander and his son Fyodor were taken to Sarai and quartered in 1339. Following the execution of Alexander Vasilievich in 1331, Ivan received the duchy of Vladimir and became the sole ruler of northeastern Russia. Favor from the khan of the Golden Horde allowed Moscow to gain power rapidly at the expense of Tver, with Tver eventually losing all influence to Moscow. However, a new rivalry was formed between the princes of Suzdal-Nizhny Novgorod. The relative power of Moscow and their strong alliance with the Horde led to a period of relative peace in Russia that was not interrupted until the reign of Dmitry Donskoy, the first prince of Moscow to openly challenge the Horde.

Three of the king's own brothers openly raised a rebellion in 1501. Mohnyin, Ava's former vassal, now began to raid its territory. In 1507, Ava ceded to Mohnyin all northern Avan territory down to present-day Shwebo in the vain hope that the raids would stop. It did not. Ava desperately tried to retain Toungoo's loyalty by ceding the key Kyaukse granary to Toungoo but it too failed. Toungoo took the region but formally broke away in 1510. Ava's only ally was the Shan state of Thibaw , which too was fighting Mohnyin's raids on its territory. Mohnyin was attacking other Shan states when it was not raiding Ava. It seized Bhamo from Thibaw in 1512 in the east, and raiding Kale in the west. The Ava-Thibaw alliance was able to retake Shwebo for a time but Mohnyin proved too strong. By the early 1520s, Chief Sawlon of Mohnyin had assembled a confederation of Shan states  under his leadership. Prome had also joined the confederation. The confederation wiped out Ava's defences in Shwebo in 1524. Finally on 25 March 1527, the forces of the confederation and Prome took Ava. The Confederation later sacked Prome in 1533 because Sawlon felt that Prome had not given sufficient help.\", 'answers': ['Bhamo', 'Kale']}]\n",

However, they are much more likely to have high blood pressure or borderline hypertension when compared with men who aren\\'t professional athletes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"It\\'s a step in the right direction to have this study,\" says Justin Bannan, 30, who plays defensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens and took part in the research. \"I think the more information we can find out and the more studies we can do, the better.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe study, published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, is important, particularly as more and more players are weighing in at 300-plus pounds. The extra weight could potentially strain an athlete\\'s heart in youth or even after retirement, and many question whether it has played a role in a handful of high-profile deaths. Health.com: Eat right advice: Fiber, starch, fats, serving sizes\\n\\n\\n\\nIn particular, the death of Thomas Herrion at age 23 has raised concerns about the heart health of larger players. Herrion, who was 6\\'3\" and 330 pounds, had just finished an exhibition game with the San Francisco 49ers when he collapsed and died in 2005.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He\\'s sort of the prototype of the bigger, stronger linemen that populates the NFL now, as compared with 20 or 30 years ago,\" says lead study author Dr. Andrew M. Tucker, the team physician for the Baltimore Ravens. \"We have so many big, strong guys over 300 pounds. I think that case in particular was important in stimulating the whole study and the investigation.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOther heavy players-- such as defensive end Reggie White-- have also died at an early age. White was 43 when he died from cardiac arrhythmia in 2004.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the study, Tucker, who is the cochair of the NFL subcommittee on cardiovascular health, and his colleagues looked at 504 active players from 12 teams in 2007. The researchers measured the players\\' height, weight, percentage of body fat, and other factors, and then compared them to 1,959 men ages 23 to 35 who participated in a study called CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults). Health.com: 20 little ways to lose drop the pounds and keep them off\\n\\n\\n\\nThey found that players were less likely to smoke or have blood-sugar problems than other men (only 6.7 percent of players had impaired fasting glucose compared to 15.5 percent of other men) and their cholesterol levels were essentially the same. However, 13.8 percent of players had high blood pressure and 64.5 percent had prehypertension, or borderline high blood pressure, compared to 5.5 percent and 24.2 percent of other men, respectively.\\n\\n\\n\\nTucker notes that the football players outweighed the men in the CARDIA study by an average of 70 pounds and that it\\'s natural to assume that larger people may have higher blood pressure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But what was fascinating to us was the category of prehypertension,\" says  Tucker, who is also the medical director of sports medicine at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. Health.com: How to eat out without getting fat\\n\\n\\n\\nThe study found that NFL athletes are more likely to have prehypertension than other men-- regardless of the size of the player or his position.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"So our lean players who play defensive back and wide receiver, they have prevalence of prehypertension just as common as the really big guys playing offensive and defensive line,\" says Tucker. \"So there\\'s something that we\\'re trying to investigate now that accounts for elevated blood pressures in our active players that is not accounted for by size alone-- there\\'s got to be something else.\" Health.com: Cut up to 900 calories with simple substitutions\\n\\n\\n\\nThat \"something else\" could be strength or resistance training, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sleep apnea (which is characterized by heavy snoring and a hike in blood pressure), or diet, including excessive sodium intake. Dr. Tucker doesn\\'t think anabolic steroids are to blame.

He was the author of a report last month by the organization\\'s commission on the use of standardized tests.\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid Hawkins says test scores shouldn\\'t be used to rank college quality\\n\\n\\n\\nARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- A recent controversy at Baylor University has brought new attention to the widespread misuse of standardized college admission tests to rank the quality of America\\'s colleges and universities.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe SAT and ACT have achieved nearly iconic status in America and throughout the world. As the late author and scholar Stephen Jay Gould noted, the tests are viewed by many as \"abstruse and mysterious,\" with powerful effects on public policy, social mobility, and even individual identity.\\n\\n\\n\\nMisuse of test scores as college ranking criteria creates undue pressure on admission offices to pursue increasingly high test scores and fuels the tests\\' disproportionate influence.\\n\\n\\n\\nLast June, Baylor University encouraged its already admitted first-year students to retake the SAT. The reward for students who retook the test was $300 in bookstore credits. Students who increased their score by more than 50 points got a $1,000 merit aid scholarship. If enough students retook the SAT and increased their scores, the gains might be enough to move Baylor up the rankings list.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe scarce financial resources allocated for this plan are too badly needed elsewhere, particularly among low-income students in rural and urban areas around the country, to spend on an effort to raise a college\\'s SAT profile. A Baylor spokesman told The Associated Press Thursday that the university \"goofed\" and would likely end the incentives.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s critical to understand that high SAT and ACT scores alone do not equate to merit. Last month, our organization\\'s Commission on the Use of Standardized Tests in Undergraduate Admission issued a report calling for change in the way everyone involved in college admissions uses the tests.\\n\\n\\n\\nTest misuses feed the public perception that the scores are the most influential factor in college admission. For the past 15 years, National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) research has shown that students\\' grades in high school, particularly grades in college preparatory courses, are by far the most important consideration in college admission decisions.\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the most pressing problems regarding the SAT and ACT scores is their misuse in the U.S. News and World Report college rankings formula.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe SAT and ACT were designed to provide information about a student to colleges and universities and were never meant to be measures of college quality. Accordingly, the commission encouraged U.S. News and World Report to eliminate test scores as a measure of institutional quality.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe U.S. News ranking formula includes a \"student selectivity\" score that constitutes 15 percent of a college\\'s overall rank. SAT or ACT scores of enrollees make up 50 percent of the student selectivity score.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn response to the NACAC report, U.S. News and World Report said, \"As long as standardized tests play an integral role in the college admissions process, U.S. News will use them as part of our ranking methodology.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe situation at Baylor is a reminder of the inflated value assigned to the SAT and ACT in higher education. The fervor surrounding the rankings, as well as the lengths to which colleges go to increase them, are unfortunate distractions in higher education and admissions.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe impression students and families get from the rankings is that higher test scores mean higher quality colleges. To borrow a phrase familiar to admission deans, many colleges recruit great students and then graduate great students. Is that because of the institution, or the students?\\n\\n\\n\\nSome credit undoubtedly should go to both. But is a college of lower quality because its students\\' SAT scores are lower than those of students at another college?\\n\\n\\n\\nGenerally speaking, the ability of admission tests to predict success in higher education is much more limited than most people think. Colleges most often determine the utility of admission test scores by assessing how well they predict first-year grades.\\n\\n\\n\\nColleges are wrong to place so much emphasis on test scores as measurements of their institutional worth when admission offices across the board consider the scores to be one among many indicators of a student\\'s merit.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs influential as the rankings have been with students and families, is it any wonder that colleges whose stakeholders often demand higher ranks go to such lengths to influence their position in the rankings?\\n\\n\\n\\nMisuse of test scores has real ramifications for students and families. For every student able to afford test-performance tutoring and fees for taking the test many times, there are many qualified students from under-served backgrounds who become discouraged that they will be unable to compete.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor every college that raises its SAT or ACT profile for rankings purposes, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of qualified students who will never apply because artificially inflated test scores signal yet another barrier to higher education.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is critical to re-evaluate the varied uses of admission tests, and protect against their misuse in all forms.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Hawkins.', 'answers': ['in college preparatory courses, are by far the most important consideration in college admission decisions.']}, {'question': 'Who are in a power struggle?', 'passage': '(CNN)  -- At least 23 people died Saturday when a protest rally turned violent outside Madagascar\\'s Presidential Palace, a fire official at the main hospital said.\\n\\n\\n\\nPeople duck to avoid gunfire Saturday in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe official said 83 people were injured during the demonstration in the capital city of Antananarivo, according to journalist Dregoire Pourtier, who passed the information to CNN.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross helped at least 18 injured people, press officer Mbola Ramamanana said.\\n\\n\\n\\nBrittany Martin, an American who is a Harvard Fellow and lives near the palace, said she could hear the crowd cheering amid intermittent gunshots and noises that may have been tear gas canisters. iReport.com: Are you there?\\n\\n\\n\\n\"From the window I can see military cars and ambulances driving by,\" Martin said. \"Nothing is up in smoke.

It won\\'t come from me as sergeant in the Cambridge Police Department,\" Crowley told Boston radio station WEEI. \"Whatever anybody else chooses to do in the name of the city of Cambridge or the Cambridge Police Department, which are beyond my control, I don\\'t worry about that. I know what I did was right. I have nothing to apologize for.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mayor of Cambridge said she will meet with the city\\'s police chief to make sure the scenario that led to Gates\\' arrest does not happen again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This suggests that something happened that should not have happened,\" E. Denise Simmons, Cambridge\\'s mayor said on CNN\\'s \"American Morning.\" \"The situation is certainly unfortunate. This can\\'t happen again in Cambridge.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nObama defended Gates Wednesday night, while acknowledging that he may be \"a little biased,\" because Gates is a friend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"But I think it\\'s fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry; No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, No. 3 ... that there\\'s a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incident, Obama said, shows \"how race remains a factor in this society.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nCrowley also said he is exercising caution and his previous actions clearly show he is not a racist.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fact, Crowley taught a racial profiling course at the Lowell Police Academy, said Deborah Friedl, deputy superintendent of the police department.\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year was his fifth year as a co-instructor of the course, Friedl said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"He seems to be a highly regarded £instructor at the academy. He consistently received high praise from students,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n\\nGates told CNN Wednesday that although charges had been dropped, he will keep the issue alive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"This is not about me; this is about the vulnerability of black men in America,\" Gates told CNN\\'s Soledad O\\'Brien.\\n\\n\\n\\nGates said the Cambridge mayor had called him to apologize about the incident. Simmons, Cambridge\\'s first black female mayor, confirmed to CNN that she apologized to Gates.\\n\\n\\n\\nGates said he\\'d be prepared to forgive the arresting officer \"if he told the truth\" about what the director of Harvard\\'s W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research said were \"fabrications\" in the police report. iReport.com: Join the conversation on racial profiling\\n\\n\\n\\nCrowley wrote in the Cambridge police report that Gates refused to step outside to speak with him, and when Crowley told Gates that he was investigating a possible break-in, Gates opened the front door and exclaimed, \"Why, because I\\'m a black man in America?\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe report said Gates initially refused to show the officer identification, but eventually produced a Harvard identification card, prompting Crowley to radio for Harvard University Police.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"While I was led to believe that Gates was lawfully in the residence, I was quite surprised and confused with the behavior he exhibited toward me,\" Crowley said, according to the report.\\n\\n\\n\\nGates was arrested for \"loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space\" and was released from police custody after spending four hours at the police station.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said Wednesday that he and his lawyers were considering further actions, not excluding a lawsuit.\\n\\n\\n\\nGates said that although the ordeal had upset him, \"I would do the same thing exactly again.\"', 'answers': ['Henry Louis Gates Jr.', 'noAnswer']}]\n"
